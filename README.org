* Schedule Checker App
A lightweight Flask-based web application to process and visualize class schedules. This app allows users to upload schedule files, process them, and generate interactive visualizations for analysis.

** Features
- *File Upload:* Upload schedule files (e.g., Excel) via a web interface.
- *Processing:* Automatically process the uploaded file to clean and standardize the data.
- *Visualizations:*
  - Instructor-based schedule charts.
  - Room-based schedule charts.
- *Interactive Interface:* Access processed files and visualizations directly from the app.

** Requirements
- Python 3.11+
- Flask
- Pandas
- Altair
- uWSGI (for production deployment)
- Docker (for containerized/production runs)

** Getting the code

Clone the repository:
   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
   git clone https://github.com/maliky/schedule_checker_app.git
   cd schedule_checker_app
   #+END_SRC

2. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:
    #+BEGIN_SRC bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    #+END_SRC

3. Start the development server (Flask runs on http://127.0.0.1:5000):
    #+BEGIN_SRC bash
    ./run.sh dev
    #+END_SRC

4. Visit http://localhost:5000 in your browser to use the app.

** Running with Docker / Production
`run.sh` also handles the production workflow by building and starting the dockerized application. By default the container exposes the uWSGI server on port 8080.

1. Build and run using the helper script:
   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
   ./run.sh prod
   #+END_SRC

2. (Optional) Equivalent manual commands if you would like direct control:
   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
   docker build -t schedule_checker_app:latest .
   docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 schedule_checker_app:latest
   #+END_SRC

Make sure Docker is installed locally before launching the production target.
